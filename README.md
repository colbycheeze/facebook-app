[The Odin Project Rails Final Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/final-project?ref=lc-pb)

###Features
1. Uses Postgresql and deploys to Heroku
2. Sign in and auth via Devise and Omniauth
3. Users can friend others
4. Users can post, and like posts, or leave comments on posts
5. Users have a timeline, profile with photo, and info
6. Sendgrid is used to send confirmation emails to users on sign-up
7. Styling is an afterthought, but I decided to try out foundation for this project
8. RSpec was used for testing, and this was also my first attempt at using it rather than the built in testing.
